fullstackopen.com is a full stack web development course offered by the University of Helsinki.
I have found it to be the best offering on the web for developing the key skills necessary as a web developer.

The general description provided by the course is:

Deep diving into modern web application development
The course introduces modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on single page applications implemented with the React library,
and REST interfaces implemented with Node.js that support them. The course also introduces an alternative implementation principle to GraphQL, or REST
The course also covers application testing, configuration and management of runtime environments, and the use of the MongoDB database to store application data.
